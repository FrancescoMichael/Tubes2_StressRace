## General Information
WikiRace is a game designed to find the shortest path between two Wikipedia articles. This web-based project facilitates the search using either the Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) algorithms. Users can input the starting and target Wikipedia titles, choose the algorithm to use, and specify whether they seek a single solution or multiple solutions. Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) is a search algorithm that works by  repeatedly executing a depth-limited version of depth-first search (DFS), increasing the depth limit with each iteration until it finds the solution. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a search algorithm that
